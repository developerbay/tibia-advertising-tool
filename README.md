# Tibia Advertising Tool
A tool created in C# that will help you advertise on Tibia via private messaging.
It loads a list of players online on a specific game world. And when you select a player, it will automatically copy a pre-set message that you want to send to the player. Then you can just simply paste it into Tibia, instead of having to copy back and forth. It's a lot easier to use this, as you don't have to paste their character names.

## Features
You can update the world list by yourself in the "settings/worlds.txt" file whenever a new world is created or a world is merged, to keep up to date.

You can randomize the player list if you want (default: alphabetical order).

You can customize your message with a few different variables (You will find them in "settings/message.txt"

If you don't want to build the tool there is also a compiled version of it included!
